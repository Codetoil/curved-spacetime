ShortDescription: Curved Spacetime is a work-in-progress easy-to-use modular simulator for General Relativity. This is the Closed-World Variant.
Description: |
  Curved Spacetime is a work-in-progress computer program that simulates
  General Relativity whose goal is that it should contain a UI normal people
  can understand while simultaneously being powerful enough for Scientists
  to use.

  A Graphics Card with Ray Tracing and Vulkan 1.3 support is required to run this application.

  There are three main variants of this software:
  - The Quilt Variant, which runs Quilt Loader and is the most extendable. Requires Java 25 to be installed.
  - The Closed-World Jar Variant, which is faster but less extendable. Requires Java 25 to be installed.
  - The Closed-World Native Variant, which is the fastest but least extendable. Does not require Java 25 to be installed, but less Operating Systems are supported.
  
  This is the Closed-World Native Variant.
